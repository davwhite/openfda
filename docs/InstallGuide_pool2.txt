Installation procedure for applicationRx.

For WINDOWS

1. Download the docker container with the pool2 submission.
http://pool2.valador.net/18F/valador_pool2.tar
Be sure to save it to a location on your local drive. 
Ex: C:\Downloads\valador_pool2.tar

2. Download docker for windows 
https://github.com/boot2docker/windows-installer/releases/tag/v1.7.0

3. Run the installer and accept all defaults.

4. Once installed launch docker by clicking on "Boot2Docker Start" icon on the deskop.

5. When the startup is complete you will be at a command prompt "$". Change to the 
directory where the container has been downloaded.
cd C:\Downloads

6. Load the image into the docker environment.
docker load < valador_pool2.tar  

7. Get the IP address of the docker client. We will use this to actually connect to the 
container. Type "boot2docker ip". Make note of the ip address as we will need it later.

8. Type "docker images" to display the downloaded image information. The valador image 
should be named "valador_pool2"

9. Start the container by typing 
docker run -p 80:8080 -i -t valador_pool2

10. You will get a new prompt looking something like this "[root@f217f9c3ee07 /]#"  
You are now connected to the container. To start the application type 
./start-apprx.sh

11. A few message will dispay, but when the prompt comes back the application will 
be running.  DO NOT close the window as this will stop the container. Open an browser 
and enter the ip address we recorded earlier. 


The application is now running fully contained in your environment.  All functionality 
will be available.  



Stopping the container

1. Type "exit" at the prompt

2. type "docker ps -a". This will list all running containers. We want the CONTAINER ID 
of the one we just exited. It shold be the only one listed. 

3. Delete the container by typing "docker rm CONTAINERID".  

If more than one CONTAINER ID is listed and you want to delete them as well just add them 
to the statement. Ex: "docker rm CONTAINERID ANOTHERCONTAINERID etc.
